# Introduction

This project mainly compares and contrasts between the **RUST Programming Language**, and the **C++ Programming Language.** We focus on the **Cargo and Clang Compilers** respectively, since they are both based on the **LLVM Architecture.** Thus, the low-level assembly generated by the LLVM compiler remains uniform between the two languages, and comparisons can be made.

We focus on RUST and C++ as they are both languages which are used in low-level systems programming. While the low-level LLVM compiler supports virtually any language, and currently is used for R, Python, Swift, and countless others; RUST and C++ insights give data for low-level programs, i.e. the layer on top of which all other programs are run.

## Before we begin: a definition of terms
