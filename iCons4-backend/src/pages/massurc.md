## Abstract 1

The following thesis is a meta-analysis of the Performance Differences between RUST and C++, two of the most widely used low-level programming languages. The key difference between the two languages are the years of advancements between the two: C++ originated in the 70s and has decades of research and development, making it the most widely adopted language in the development of low-level systems. On the other hand, RUST, released in 2013, was created primarily to fix C++’s shortcomings: memory management, error logging, and debugging. 

By comparing the performance differences between the two languages, we can determine the Return on Investment, should an undertaking be made to refactor code into the new language.

If RUST enables, through it’s various carefully-constructed safety paradigms, about 5% more efficiency in servers, this would result in savings of about 10.25 terawatt-hours of electricity. That number is greater than the electricity used in about 119 countries of the world, even while having taken only conservative metrics, since inter-connection of servers through Networking, and a higher efficiency of consumer electronics (or client devices) has not been taken into consideration.
