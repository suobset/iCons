                Along with the Efficiency and Safety aspects of Hydrogen, another variable that we wanted to target for 
                this Case Study was Cost. Our Hypothesis was that it has to be the Cost vs. Efficiency ratio of Hydrogen
                which would aid in widening its appeal as a Fossil Fuel replacement. Basically, Hydrogen has to at least
                cost less, and be more efficient than traditional Fossil Fuels for it to be widely adopted. 

                However, targeting cost in itself turned out to be a huge challenge for us. Even just in the U.S., State 
                laws regarding Hydrogen Fuel vary a lot: some states like California provide a lot of incentives and grants
                to build a Hydrogen Fuel infrastructure, while some other states completely neglect building a Hydrogen Infrastructure.
                
                The Map below shows the amount incentives taken by each state for building and facilitating a Hydrogen Infrastructure, and the graph 
                below compares that number to the number of incentives taken by the U.S. for other Alternate Forms of Evergy:
