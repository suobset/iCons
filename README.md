## iCons 1: Case Study 2 (Team 6 Hydrogen Viewer)

A website which was created as an extension to our Poster. Our Research was "Filling in gap of ways to make Hydrogen Energy more Accessible and Reliable". The website was created as an interactive means for the audience to view the data and the future scope of the project. 

The main poster along with the research data and the sources can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rl3o4Oow5fyl0XPS_FKG08Z8-gC7tRm8D_qi6X6LMBE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The website was created as a companion to go alongside said poster. The link was given to all before the presentatioon, and the audience could play around with the website while listening about our research.
