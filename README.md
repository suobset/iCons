# iCons Case Study 2: Team 6 extended data

## Created as an extension to the data plotted on our poster
### Team 6: Kush, Ben, Aadit, Bryan

The following "website" you see was coded by me in an all-nighter, in an overly-optimistic challenge I took up after being inspired with what Team 5 had in mind. It is literally a bodge in its entirety, and thus various website elements may be not correctly aligned or presented. I'm sorry for the inconvinience, and I'll be fixing this ASAP :)

ReadMe will be updated soon for everyone who wants to contribute.
